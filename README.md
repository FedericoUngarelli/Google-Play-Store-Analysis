# Google-Play-Store-Analysis
Big Data and Databases Project (2022)

The goal of my team of 5 colleagues was to carry out an analysis on a large dataset, to identify some managerial implications from the results. After choosing a dataset available on one of the several online database sources (e.g. “Kaggle”, “Dataworld”, …), the analysis was to be performed on “Knime”, a software for data analysis, manipulation, visualization, and reporting based on the graphical programming paradigm.
In particular, the dataset used for this project contained observations scraped from the internet focusing on the results of Google Play Store app downloads, users' reviews, ratings, and detailed information about the app and its author. The objective was to exploit the dataset to analyse the sales and downloads of the Google Play Store market from the point of view of new potential investors interested in entering the industry. The target variable used is "Rating”. From a managerial point of view, having the correct prediction and characteristics of a publicly appreciated application will facilitate investing in or developing a potentially successful app. Furthermore, analysing the thriving components of an excellent or terrible review will enable managers to be guided by the path of already-performing apps on the market. To complete the task, some Machine Learning algorithms (Regularized Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and Gradient Boosting Machine) were implemented after a first raw data description and tailored data preparation.
In addition, we carried out a text analysis on written reviews left by users of gaming apps to understand the main characteristics of a top-performing app in comparison to a worst-ranked application. For example, on the top of the positive adjectives used to describe the games, such as “fun”, “cool”, and “amazing”, the principal upshot given by users is regarding “advertising”. The public suggests that ads within the mobile app be removed or better managed. Moreover, we found that a top-performing game is usually “easy” to play, with facile “levels”, and provides users with “help” in case of struggle.
